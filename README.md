# Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-and-Comparison-Analysis

The incremental increase in the usage of technology has led to an increase in the amount of data
that is being processed over the Internet significantly over the time period. With the huge amount
of data that is being flown over the Internet, comes the scenario of providing security to the data,
and this is where an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) comes into the picture and helps in
detecting any virtual security threats. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that monitors
and analyzes data to detect any intrusion in the system or network. Intruders find different ways
to penetrate into a network. The IDS which is being proposed is being implemented using latest
technologies such as Machine Learning Algorithms to classify the attacks and detecting them
whenever an attack happens and also to find which machine learning algorithm is best suitable
for identifying the attack.
